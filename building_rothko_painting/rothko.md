# Building a Rothko Painting

In this course I'll be going through an Art Piece. Elements have are their own box from spacing to borders. 

To understand the **box model** I will build an Art piece called the `Rothko Painting` using the **Normal Flow** of the **box model**, and it is sometimes referred to as the **Default**.

> ## Objective
Every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas:
- One: Margin
    - Which is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements
- Two: Border
- Three: Padding
- Four: Content
