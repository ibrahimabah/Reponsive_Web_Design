> # Coloured Markers
With the correct CSS colors, webpages can be aesthetically pleasing to readers. 

> ## Objective
- How to use the `three methods` of adding `flat` coloring:  
    - The First One is **`Hex`** method, which is a common way of applying coloring  to elements. _(e.g green = `#00ff00`)_
    -  The Second being **`RGB`** coloring method: which is each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. _(e.g red =`rgb(255, 0, 0)`)_
    - And The Third **`HSL`**; _hue, saturation, lightness_, method, which accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for `hue`, a percentage from 0 to 100 for `saturation`, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for `lightness` _(e.g blue = `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)`)_
-   How to add  `gradient` and `transition` to elements:
    -   ` Gradient` is one color transitioning into another. 
    -   The  `linear-gradient` function gives you control over the `direction`and `transition` along a degree line, and which colors are used.
    -   The syntax is `linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);` and  `gradientDirection` is the direction of the line used for the transition  while `color1` and `color2` are color arguments (it can be any coloring method).
    - `Color-stops` allow you to fine-tune where colors are positioned along the gradient line. Either `px` or `percentages` units can be used in this case after the color.
